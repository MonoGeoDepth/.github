# Welcome to MonoGeoDepth üëã
A cutting-edge depth estimation method for Mars landforms, brought to you by the MonoGEOdepth research team.

## üåå About the Project
MonoGeoDepth is an integral part of our ongoing research project, **MonoGEOdepth: Monocular Depth Estimation of Planetary Landforms**. Our aim is to revolutionize the way we perceive and understand the topography of Mars.

The source code for this project, along with our research paper, will be made available upon publication. We believe in open science and are excited to share our work with the global community.

## üìù Pre-Access to Source Code
To request pre-access, please fill out the following Google Form. Our team will review your request and get back to you at the earliest.

Thank you for your interest in MonoGeoDepth. We look forward to your valuable contributions and feedback.

## üìä HiRISE DTM Dataset
HiRISE DTMs are digital terrain models created for the surface of Mars. These DTMs are generated using stereo-matching techniques on two satellite images taken from different angles as part of the High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) project.

This dataset consists of stereo pairs and their respective digital terrain models. This dataset is important for studies in depth estimation, computer vision, and geoscience fields.
